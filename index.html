  <h1>Hi, I'm Nisha.</h1>

  <p>
    When I left home at 18 to move to a new country, I didn’t have everything figured out.
    What I did have was a belief that I was meant for something greater and a deep curiosity about the world.
    That belief and curiosity have shaped every major decision I’ve made since.
  </p>

  <p>
    I pushed through challenges that made me consider dropping out of school more than once.
    Still, I graduated early, bought my first home by 22, and drove solo across the United States.
    I’ve started over more than once, not because it was easy, but because I knew that discomfort was bringing me closer to the person I was meant to become.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m currently a non-technical founder building safety management software. I hold an undergraduate degree in Business and a master’s in Business Analytics.
    I’m drawn to meaningful conversations, the kind that make me pause, reflect, and see the world through a deeper lens.
    I’ve always loved stories from the past, especially the ones that reveal how people endured hardship, adapted to change, and led with courage.
